# LDAP Alpine

This is for ArangoDB testing purposes only. The LDAP server is preloaded
with user data and dummy certificates. Other than that, the
functionality is as advertised.

The Lightweight Directory Access Protocol (LDAP) is an open, vendor-neutral,
industry standard application protocol for accessing and maintaining
distributed directory information services over an Internet Protocol (IP)
network.

This image is based on Alpine Linux and OpenLDAP.

## Customisation

Override the following environment variables when running the docker container
to customise LDAP:

| VARIABLE | DESCRIPTION | DEFAULT |
| :------- | :---------- | :------ |
| ORGANISATION_NAME | Organisation name | Example Ltd |
| SUFFIX | Organisation distinguished name | dc=example,dc=com |
| ROOT_USER | Root username | admin |
| ROOT_PW | Root password | password |
| USER_UID | Initial user's uid | pgarrett |
| USER_GIVEN_NAME | Initial user's given name | Phill |
| USER_SURNAME | Initial user's surname | Garrett |
| USER_EMAIL | Initial user's email | pgarrett@example.com |
| USER_PW | Initial user's password | password |
| LOG_LEVEL | LDAP logging level, see below for valid values. | stats |

For example:

```
docker run -e ORGANISATION_NAME="Beispiel gmbh" \
  -e SUFFIX="dc=beispiel,dc=de" \
  -e ROOT_PW="geheimnis" \
  pgarrett/ldap-alpine
```

## Logging Levels

| NAME | DESCRIPTION |
| :--- | :---------- |
| any | enable all debugging (warning! lots of messages will be output) |
| trace | trace function calls |
| packets | debug packet handling |
| args | heavy trace debugging |
| conns | connection management |
| BER | print out packets sent and received |
| filter | search filter processing |
| config | configuration processing |
| ACL | access control list processing |
| stats | stats log connections/operations/results |
| stats2 | stats log entries sent |
| shell | print communication with shell backends |
| parse | print entry parsing debugging |
| sync | syncrepl consumer processing |
| none | only messages that get logged whatever log level is set |

## Custom ldif files

`*.ldif` files can be used to add lots of people to the organisation on
startup.

Copy ldif files to /ldif and the container will execute them. This can be
done either by extending this Dockerfile with your own:

```
FROM pgarrett/ldap-alpine
COPY my-users.ldif /ldif/
```

Or by mounting your scripts directory into the container:

```
docker run -v /my-ldif:/ldif pgarrett/ldap-alpine
```

## Persist data

The container uses a standard mdb backend. To persist this database outside the
container mount `/var/lib/openldap/openldap-data`. For example:

```
docker run -v /my-backup:/var/lib/openldap/openldap-data pgarrett/ldap-alpine
```

## Transport Layer Security

The container can be started using the encrypted LDAPS protocol. You must
provide all three TLS environment variables.

| VARIABLE | DESCRIPTION | EXAMPLE |
| :------- | :---------- | :------ |
| CA_FILE | PEM-format file containing certificates for the CA's that slapd will trust | /etc/ssl/certs/ca.pem |
| KEY_FILE | The slapd server private key | /etc/ssl/certs/server.key |
| CERT_FILE | The slapd server certificate | /etc/ssl/certs/server.pem |

Note these variables inform the entrypoint script (executed on startup) where
to find the SSL certificates inside the container. So the certificates must
also be mounted at runtime too, for example:

```
docker run -v /my-certs:/etc/ssl/certs \
  -e CA_FILE /etc/ssl/certs/ca.pem \
  -e KEY_FILE /etc/ssl/certs/server.key \
  -e CERT_FILE /etc/ssl/certs/server.pem \
  neunhoef/ldap-alpine
```

Where `/my-certs` on the host contains the three certificate files `ca.pem`,
`server.key` and `server.pem`.
