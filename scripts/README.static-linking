Instructions to relink the published static executables
=======================================================

With this archive you can relink the static executables published by
ArangoDB against your version of the LGPL libraries we link against.
After extracting the archive in an empty directory, you will have
all the needed object files (.a and .o files). The scripts directory
has an example script for linking.

This has been tested on Ubuntu 23.10, since you need glibc in version 
at least 2.38. Install the following packages as tools:

    apt install build-essential clang-16 lld-16 liburing-dev

Then run the script `scripts/link_executables.sh` and you will find
the following executables in the `build/bin` directory:

  - arangod
  - arangobench
  - arangodump
  - arangorestore
  - arangosh
  - arangovpack
  - arangoexport
  - arangoimport
  - arangobackup
