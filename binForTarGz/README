ArangoDB
--------

In order to use a tar installation simply add the `arangodb-VERSION/bin`
directory to your path.

For bash, use

    unix> export PATH="/full/path/to/unpacked/arangodb-3.4.0/bin:$PATH"

If you have additionally installed arangodb as Debian or RPM package, 
you need to ensure that `arangodb-VERSION/bin` comes first in the PATH 
variable. Otherwise the binaries from the installed `arangodb` package 
will be used and not the ones from the tar file.


Single Server
=============

Use

    arangodb --starter.mode single --starter.data-dir /tmp/mydata

where `/tmp/mydata` should point to the directory containing the
data. The database itself will be in `/tmp/mydata/single8529/data`.
The apps will be stored in `/tmp/mydata/single8529/apps`.

    arangodb --starter.mode activefailover --starter.data-dir /tmp/mydata

Please then read the instructions printed on screen for starting the
