ArangoDB
--------

In order to use a tar installation simply add the `@ARANGODB_PACKAGE_NAME@/bin`
directory to your path.

For bash, use

    unix> export PATH="/full/path/to/unpacked/@ARANGODB_PACKAGE_NAME@/bin:$PATH"

If you have additionally installed arangodb as Debian or RPM package, 
you need to ensure that `@ARANGODB_PACKAGE_NAME@` comes first in the PATH
variable. Otherwise the binaries from the installed `arangodb` package 
will be used and not the ones from the tar file.
