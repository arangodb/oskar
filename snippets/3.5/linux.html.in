    The release candidate is feature complete and contains all enhancements that
    will be released with the GA. However, there are known issues, see
    <a href="https://www.arangodb.com/docs/devel/release-notes-known-issues35.html">
      known issues in the Release Candidate @ARANGODB_VERSION_RELEASE_NUMBER@ of ArangoDB 3.5
    </a>.

    Especially, when you are testing the candidate on an existing dataset follow
    the instruction in the link above and always use a copy of your data! Never
    try it on a productive dataset.

    In case that your data from ArangoDB 3.4 contains views, you need to delete
    the views first. Do not use the automatic update procedure.

    We provide a <strong>Tar</strong> package containing the server
    and client tools, which can be unpacked in any location and which
    does not require root rights for installation.

  <p>
    The processor(s) must support the SSE 4.2 instruction set (Intel
