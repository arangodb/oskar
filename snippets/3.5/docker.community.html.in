    The release candidate is feature complete and contains all enhancements that
    will be released with the GA. However, there are known issues, see
    <a href="https://www.arangodb.com/docs/devel/release-notes-known-issues35.html">
      known issues in the Release Candidate @ARANGODB_VERSION_RELEASE_NUMBER@ of ArangoDB 3.5
    </a>.

    Especially, when you are testing the candidate on an existing dataset follow
    the instruction in the link above and always use a copy of your data! Never
    try it on a productive dataset.

    In case that your data from ArangoDB 3.4 contains views, you need to delete
    the views first. Do not use the automatic update procedure.
  </p>
  <p>
    ArangoDB is available as Docker container.
  </p>
  <p>
    The processor(s) must support the SSE 4.2 instruction set (Intel
    Nehalem or better, AMD Bulldozer or better, etc.)
  </p>
  <p>
    In order to install the stand-alone version use
    <pre>docker run -p 8529:8529 -e ARANGO_ROOT_PASSWORD=openSesame @DOCKER_IMAGE@</pre>
