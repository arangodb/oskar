    The release candidate is feature complete and contains all enhancements that
    will be released with the GA. However, there are known issues, see

      known issues in the Release Candidate @ARANGODB_VERSION_RELEASE_NUMBER@ of ArangoDB 3.5

    Especially, when you are testing the candidate on an existing dataset follow
    the instruction in the link above and always use a copy of your data! Never
    try it on a productive dataset.

    In case that your data from ArangoDB 3.4 contains views, you need to delete
    the views first. Do not use the automatic update procedure.

    ArangoDB is available for Kubernetes.

  <p>
    The processor(s) must support the SSE 4.2 instruction set (Intel

    In order to install ArangoDB in your Kubernetes Cluster, first
    deploy the latest operator. Instructions how to do so can be found
